                        <p>
                        Hotel Das Cataratas is one of the latest luxury hotels to (re-)open in the soon-to-be Olympic capital. 
                        Fresh from a major restoration and refurbishment, the Belle Epoque property houses 294 rooms, some on two levels in 
                        rooftop turrets, and a David Collins-designed bar and restaurant. But the showstopper is Espa Life, a four-story 
                        "next-generation" spa with an amphitheater sauna.
                        </p>
        <p>
        London has witnessed an incredible number of luxury hotel (re-)openings of late, but the Corinthia is a standout for the flagship Espa Life, interiors by David Collins, a seafood restaurant by flamboyant Roman restaurateur Massimo Riccioli and a history of aristocrats and spies. (It was once home to the Ministry of Defence.) 
        </p>
        <p>
        The elegant lobby shows off a dramatic Baccarat "Full Moon" chandelier and bespoke artwork.The approach to the hotel along the Thames Embankment is rather charmless, but the stone building on Whitehall Place is reassuringly colossal. On entering I am confronted by a magnificent Baccarat “Full Moon” chandelier and resin panels of the Thames by the art collective Based Upon. Eye-catching artwork is a feature of all the public areas — look out for London-based Claire Brewster’s ingenious cutout birds created from vintage maps. 
        </p>
        <p>
        This quirky Bassoon Bar was unjustly empty on my visit, but it is worth a stop for the creative cocktail menu and proficient bartenders. The Northall, where the Michelin-starred Gary Holliheed champions British produce, was also on the quiet side, but the staff is friendly and forthcoming. I happily ate salmon smoked over calvados and sole meunière, while a couple looked sheepish as their young daughter rolled around on the floor.
        </p>
        <p>
        All 294 guestrooms are spacious by London standards, with beds dressed in cloud-like duvets and views over the city or to the interior courtyard. The Italian-made marble bathrooms have enormous walk-in showers, deep tubs and in-wall TVs. For alternative relaxation, however, make for the 35,000-square-foot Espa Life complex. Beginning on a mysterious mezzanine level, it descends through four ever-darkening floors to a phenomenal thermal suite. Back in the real world for breakfast at the sunlit Northall, I was left wondering what I could sell on eBay to cover the $5,700 annual membership.
